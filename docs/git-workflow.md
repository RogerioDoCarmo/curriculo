# Git Workflow Guide

## Overview

This project uses a **protected branch workflow** to ensure code quality and prevent accidental commits to main branches.

## Branch Protection Rules

### Protected Branches

- **`main`** - Production branch (protected)
- **`develop`** - Development branch (protected)

### What "Protected" Means

- ❌ Cannot push directly to these branches
- ❌ Cannot force push
- ✅ Must create Pull Requests
- ✅ Must pass CI/CD checks
- ✅ May require code review (depending on settings)

---

## Standard Workflow

### 1. Check Current Branch

**ALWAYS check your current branch before making changes:**

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Expected output**: Should be a feature branch (e.g., `feature/my-feature`)

**If you see `main` or `develop`**: STOP! Create a feature branch first.

### 2. Create Feature Branch

If you're on `main` or `develop`, create a feature branch:

```bash
# From main or develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch naming conventions:**

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/seo-submission-task`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/contact-form-validation`)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/simplify-auth`)
- `test/` - Test additions/updates (e.g., `test/add-unit-tests`)
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

### 3. Make Your Changes

Work on your feature branch:

```bash
# Edit files
# ...

# Check status
git status

# Stage changes
git add <files>

# Commit with conventional commit message
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

### 4. Push Feature Branch

Push your feature branch to remote:

```bash
# First push (sets up tracking)
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Subsequent pushes
git push
```

### 5. Create Pull Request

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Compare & pull request" (appears after push)
3. Select base branch:
   - For features: `develop`
   - For hotfixes: `main`
4. Fill in PR template:
   - Title: Clear, descriptive
   - Description: What, why, how
   - Link related issues
5. Click "Create pull request"

### 6. Wait for CI/CD Checks

Your PR will trigger automated checks:

- ✅ Lint
- ✅ Type Check
- ✅ Tests
- ✅ Coverage
- ✅ Build
- ✅ E2E Tests
- ✅ Lighthouse
- ✅ SonarQube

**All checks must pass before merging.**

### 7. Address Review Feedback

If reviewers request changes:

```bash
# Make changes on your feature branch
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
git push
```

The PR will automatically update.

### 8. Merge Pull Request

Once approved and all checks pass:

1. Click "Merge pull request" on GitHub
2. Choose merge strategy:
   - **Squash and merge** (recommended for clean history)
   - **Merge commit** (preserves all commits)
   - **Rebase and merge** (linear history)
3. Confirm merge
4. Delete branch on GitHub (optional but recommended)

### 9. Update Local Branches

After PR is merged:

```bash
# Switch to develop
git checkout develop

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin develop

# If merged to main, also update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete local feature branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

# Delete remote feature branch (if not done on GitHub)
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Accidentally on Main

**Problem**: You made changes on `main` branch

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current
# Output: main

# Stash your changes
git stash

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Apply stashed changes
git stash pop

# Now commit on feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat: my changes"
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
```

### Scenario 2: Forgot to Create Feature Branch

**Problem**: You already committed to `main` or `develop`

**Solution**:

```bash
# Create feature branch from current position
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Force update main/develop to match remote (discards local commits)
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# Switch back to feature branch
git checkout feature/my-feature

# Your commits are now on the feature branch
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
```

### Scenario 3: Need to Update Feature Branch with Latest Changes

**Problem**: Your feature branch is behind `develop`

**Solution**:

```bash
# On your feature branch
git checkout feature/my-feature

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Rebase on develop (recommended)
git rebase origin/develop

# Or merge develop into your branch
git merge origin/develop

# Push (may need force push if rebased)
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Scenario 4: Merge Conflicts

**Problem**: Your PR has merge conflicts

**Solution**:

```bash
# On your feature branch
git checkout feature/my-feature

# Fetch and merge develop
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop

# Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Look for <<<<<<< HEAD markers

# After resolving, stage files
git add <resolved-files>

# Complete merge
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts"

# Push
git push
```

### Scenario 5: Want to Undo Last Commit

**Problem**: You committed something wrong

**Solution**:

```bash
# Undo last commit, keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Make corrections
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: corrected version"

# If already pushed, force push (use with caution!)
git push --force-with-lease
```

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- ✅ **Always check current branch** before making changes
- ✅ **Create feature branches** for all work
- ✅ **Use descriptive branch names** (e.g., `feature/add-seo-task`)
- ✅ **Write clear commit messages** (follow Conventional Commits)
- ✅ **Keep PRs focused** (one feature/fix per PR)
- ✅ **Update your branch** regularly with latest changes
- ✅ **Run tests locally** before pushing
- ✅ **Delete merged branches** to keep repo clean
- ✅ **Pull latest changes** after merging PRs

### Don'ts ❌

- ❌ **Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`**
- ❌ **Never force push to protected branches**
- ❌ **Don't create PRs with failing tests**
- ❌ **Don't merge your own PRs** (unless you're the only developer)
- ❌ **Don't leave stale branches** (delete after merge)
- ❌ **Don't commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords)
- ❌ **Don't commit large binary files** (use Git LFS if needed)
- ❌ **Don't rewrite public history** (avoid force push on shared branches)

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Checks

Every PR triggers these checks:

| Check          | Description           | Must Pass |
| -------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| **Lint**       | ESLint code quality   | ✅ Yes    |
| **Type Check** | TypeScript validation | ✅ Yes    |
| **Test**       | Unit tests            | ✅ Yes    |
| **Coverage**   | Test coverage (71%+)  | ✅ Yes    |
| **Build**      | Production build      | ✅ Yes    |
| **E2E**        | End-to-end tests      | ✅ Yes    |
| **Lighthouse** | Performance tests     | ✅ Yes    |
| **SonarQube**  | Code quality analysis | ✅ Yes    |

### If Checks Fail

1. **Review the error logs** in GitHub Actions
2. **Fix the issues** on your feature branch
3. **Commit and push** the fixes
4. **Wait for checks** to run again

**Develop Branch**:

- ✅ Require pull request before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date

### To View/Update Settings

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Branches**
3. View **Branch protection rules**

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Protected branch update failed"

**Cause**: Trying to push directly to `main` or `develop`

**Solution**: Create a feature branch and PR instead

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
```

### Error: "Updates were rejected"

**Cause**: Your branch is behind the remote

**Solution**: Pull latest changes first

```bash
git pull origin feature/my-feature
# Or if you want to rebase
git pull --rebase origin feature/my-feature
```

### Error: "Merge conflicts"

**Cause**: Your changes conflict with other changes

**Solution**: Resolve conflicts manually

```bash
# Update your branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop

# Resolve conflicts in editor
# Stage resolved files
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts"
git push
```
